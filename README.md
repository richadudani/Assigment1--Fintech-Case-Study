# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## WEALTHSIMPLE: A new type of Financial Advisor or Canada's Top Robo-Advisor

## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
    "Wealthsimple Inc." is a Canadian online investment management service company.
    
### When was the company incorporated? 
    The company was founded 5 years ago in September 2014 in Toronto.

### Who are the founders of the company?
    Michael Katchen, Rudy Adler and Brett Huneycutt

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    Current CEO Michael, before founding Wealthsimple created a company called "1000memories" which allowed people to organize, share, and discover old photos and memories and set up family trees. It was bought by another company called "Ancestry.com". This resulted in Michael left with time and money to invest. His co-founders asked Michael for advise, who then shared the excel based tool that was created by him based on his understanding of managing money. This was met with the founders turning back to Michael for advise rather than go through the spreadsheet due to their lack of time or interest in the area of investing or going through the boring spreasheet tool. This ignited the idea of doing something for all, because wealth works better if everyone has access to simpler and smarter way of managing it. 
  
### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    *  In May 2014 the company initially raised CAD $1.9 million from investors Eric Kirzner, Joe Canavan, and Roger Martin.
    *  In April 2015, the firm received CAD $10 million from Power Financial Corporation in an agreement structured to allow for a future  investment of CAD $20 million within 12 months. In total Power Financial Corporation has invested $30 million in Series A funding.
    *  In 2016, 2017 and 2018 Power Financial Corporation invested CAD $20 millions, CAD $50 millions and CAD $65 millions respectively . It is now primarily owned by Power Corporation indirectly over 75% through (the investments were through their holdings in Power Financial, IGM Financial and Portag3).
    *  In May 2019, Wealthsimple secured a CAD $100 million investment round, led by Allianz X, the digital investment unit of German asset manager Allianz Group.

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * International Footprint -  Wealthsimple is trying to expand its international footprints through partnerships which is currently under process
  
    * Domestic Expansion - In Canada, they are the biggest player in the "digital space" at 70% market share but they continue capturing market share through new products and services. They have registered three new businesses in 2019 namely Wealthsimple Cash in June 2019, Wealthsimple Payments in August, and Wealthsimple Digital Assets, issued in October 2019.
  
    * Expansion in untapped market - Currently the digital space is small but there is a huge opportunity to grow in the future. This is primarily driven by bad reputation of banks in servicing, innovation, moderization and not been able to meet the demands of consumers across generations. Wealthsimple is trying to exploit this opportunity by leveraging their 150,000 clients which are mostly young professionals. This entire generation of clients have higher risk appetite, are hungry for more out of a relationship in terms of higher adoption to new services and open attitude in trying new products.
  
    * Streamlining their business - Wealthsimple is in process of restructuring their businesses. Recently they announced to seperate their direct to consumer and Wealthsimple for Advisors businesses and will transition the advisor-focused offering to a new company. They are in in process of looking for partners to support advisors on a new platform.

    * Achieve full stack of financial service - The vision is dependent on investments. They are now focusing on identifying the right partner to support their business on a future platform that is capable of delivering a seamless client experience with even more features and services. Potential partnerships with other FinTechs in the Power/Portag3 portfolio are also being explored.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    The Company's Customers -
    The CEO founded a business that would revolutionize wealth management for his friends and other millennials. Traditional investment companies typically target a demographic of people aged 45 and above, but Weathsimple’s CEO, Katchen, wants to bring people into the world of investment earlier. His philosophy is as follows:
   
    “Millennials are missing out on opportunities to secure their financial future,” he explained. “A lot of young people are mistrustful of big banks and put off by the paperwork. We are combining financial expertise with smart IT to shake up the industry and modernise investment.”

    The average age of Wealthsimple's customer was between 30 to 35 years with university degree when it started out. But today, Wealthsimple caters to the uninitiated millennial investor, with a reported 80% of its clients under the age of 45, and 40% of them being first-time investors. About a quarter of its clients are socially responsible investors, meaning they have money invested in Wealthsimple’s SRI portfolios, which support companies that prioritize environmental and social concerns and have a positive record on human rights and corruption.
  
    Market size of these customers -
    Although there was no concrete articles or publicatiions that could give a definite answer to this question. There is demographic information available by age published by Statistics Canada. According to 2019 study residents population between the ages of 25-29 years is 2.63 millions, 2.6 millions for 30-34 year olds and 35-39 year olds each and 2.4 millions for people between 40-44 years, totalling to over 10 millions.

    Ideally the entire 10 millions can be my potential market share. However, there are articles/studies confirming that this is not feasible, simply because of the increasing personal debts, gender pay gaps, gender investment habits, lack of education/awareness around investing, the growing income inequality between wealthly and poor millenials. 

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Wealthsimple’s unique offerings, such as its diverse lineup of portfolio choices (including socially responsible and halal-compliant options) and unfettered access to a team of financial advisors (including some certified financial planners) for all clients, regardless of account balance gives it an advantage over competitors. It is also ideal for novice investors or those who are uneasy choosing their own investments since it recommends a portfolio of low-fee investments or individualized portfolio for large accounts which are explained below.

    Additionally, Wealthsimple is great for planning towards bigger money goals and investing/saving in tax-free accounts – retirement (RRSP), home down payment and wedding (TFSA), kids college education (RESP).

    1. Socially responsible investment options 
    Investors can choose from three risk-weighted SRI portfolios. The portfolios draw from six exchange-traded funds that focus on companies involved in enterprises such as clean technology innovation in the developing world, efforts to lower carbon exposure and supporting gender diversity in senior leadership roles. The portfolio may also contain municipal bonds that support local investment and government-issued, mortgage-backed securities that promote affordable housing.

    2. Shariah-compliant portfolio A halal investing portfolio
     One that complies with Islamic law — is another flagship service. It contains 49 individual stocks (not ETFs) screened by a third-party committee of Shariah scholars. No companies that profit from gambling, alcohol, firearms, tobacco or other restricted industries or derive significant income from interest on loans are permitted. 

    3. Low account minimum and no extra fees
    The $0 account minimum for the Wealthsimple Basic offering includes free automated deposits, automatic rebalancing and dividend reinvestment. There are no fees on transfers (in or out), trading and tax-loss harvesting. Additionally, maintaining a $100,000 minimum balance qualifies customers for the Wealthsimple Black service, which offers the same features as the Basic account at a lower management fee (0.4% versus 0.5%) with added perks such as free potrtfolio review, VIP Priority Pass membership.

    4. Investment in fractional shares 
    Like other robo-advisors, each customer's portfolio of ETFs — the exact mix of growth, international, fixed income, cash and other asset classes — is based on customers financial goals, investing experience, financial situation and risk tolerance. But the company has a bonus feature for customers who may be adding small amounts to their account over time: Wealthsimple buys fractional shares of ETFs, which allows investment of the entire deposit in full instead of hanging out in low-interest-bearing cash until there’s enough to purchase a full share.

    5. Access to a team of financial planners 
     Wealthsimple allows all customers, regardless of account balance, email and phone access to its team of financial advisors, including some certified financial planners. The advisors can discuss portfolio allocation, retirement planning, estate and tax planning and do cash-flow analyses.

    6. Customized service for high-balance account holders 
    Wealthsimple Generation is a premium service, was introduced in 2019 to serve clients who maintain a $500,000 balance (individually or per household). Generation customers are assigned two dedicated advisors who will create a holistic financial plan that includes cash-flow analysis, projections and actions to take to achieve your goals. Generation portfolios are tailor-made for each client's specific needs. 

    7. Tax-loss harvesting
    Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy used to lower an investor’s taxes on investment gains or other income by offsetting it with any investment losses. Often it is either a paid add-on service or available only to high-net-worth clients. Any Wealthsimple customer with a taxable account can have a portfolio analyst review their accounts for tax-loss opportunities.

    8. Simplicity 
    Practically everything about Wealthsimple's service — clear, straightforward pricing; beginner-friendly customer experience; a slick, no-nonsense website — is to provide just what the customer needs "simplicity". They have impressive "Help Center," where everything you need to know about fees, portfolio holdings, performance and account management is laid out clearly and transparently.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    The company used numerous technologies as they are online investment management company.
    1. For Application & Data - they use some of the leading and world-class technology and few of the examples are ;
    Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon CloundFront, React, Bootstrap, ,Oracle, Hibernate, Guice, JavaScript, nginx, Java,PostgreSQL, AngularjS,Redis, ES6, Sass, Ruby, Amazon CloundFront and many more.
    2. For Utilities - Postman, Amazon Route 53,Amazon SNS, Algolia, AWS IAM, AWS Data Pipleine, periscope, TensorFlow, Swagger UI
    3. For DevOps - GitHub, Git, Docker, Virtual Box, Ansible, gulp, CircleCI, AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog, Rollbar, Consul, PagerDuty, Zookeeper, ELK, Nomad, Rundeck   
    4. For Business Tools - Slack, Jira, Zendesk, 1Password, Azure Active Directory, Quip
    
    For implementation, let's take an example of “React”, A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
    At Wealthsimple, mobile apps are very important to the business. A significant portion of clients use them regularly to check on their accounts and to add to their savings.Inspired by posts from AirBnb, Instagram, and Artsy , company started exploring React Native back in November 2016 to see if it was something they can add to the development toolbox. Cross-platform code reuse, hot reloading, and CodePush have the potential to significantly increase how fast companycan get new features and bug fixes out to our clients. Additionally, the ability to slowly mix this into our app by integrating with our existing code base was appealing.
    
    Company Strategy
    Most of the references online that cite React Native show tremendous success when it’s used in the context of simple applications or for simple tasks. 
    As part of new onboarding flow, company started to implement a new interface forrisk score survey. This feature was isolated from the rest of our app as a single entry point and callback when the flow was complete — the perfect opportunity to test out how React Native handles transitions and communication with native code. Once happy with the result, company moved on to interlacing React Native screens with native screens
    
    Biggest Challenge — Navigation and Communication with Native Code
    One of the biggest challengethe company ran into was how to communicate and navigate seamlessly with our existing native code base.
    •	Building UI components in React Native has been a dream. Screens come together quickly across both platforms and React enables us to build a component library that we can leverage easily going forward. The challenge was making these screens work together
    •	Inspired by the AirBnb native-navigation library, company tried implementing own approach to navigating between native and React Native screens. The end result turned out much simpler than initially imagined, by leveraging Native Modules and Event Emitters.
    •	Wealthsimple app has two different scenarios: going from a React Native screen to a native screen and going from a React Native screen to another React Native screen

## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    Personal Finance/Wealth Management/Robo Advising
 
### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    Top 7 trends are as follows: 
    1) Banks entering the robo-advisor market 
    While robo-technology was pioneered by start-ups, banks are taking steps to enter the robo-advisor market. Below are the steps taken by the Canadian banks:
     * Bank of Montreal’s QuickPay solution, which leverages machine learning capabilities to recognize information across a range of corporations and statement formats, enabling customers to email their bills to BMO and has its own robo-adviser, called "SmartFolio"
    * The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offers a SME/mobile app that gives business owners a comprehensive view of their finances and provides financial insights
    * Royal Bank of Canada’s Express Track Wire Payment leverages SWIFT’s global payments innovation technology and has InvestEase
    * Bank of Nova Scotia’s eHOME tool modernizes and digitizes the entire mortgage process in real-time and without personal contact with a mortgage specialist or financial advisor; and
    * TD Canada Trust has the integrated digital mortgage application.

    2) The rise of robo-advisors, continued technologicals advances, consolidation and survival of fittest 
    According to Myprivatebanking.com, a Swiss financial research company, robo-advice jumped from $19 billion in 2015 to $43 billion in 2017. The rise of the robo-advisor seems to be unstoppable and is driven by various factors including low-interest rates,  increasing trust in computer-generated recommendations, and the availability of supercomputing and the cloud. 
    
    However, existing robo-advisors pool is expected to shrink due to industry consolidation, mergers, and acquisitions. Larger asset and investment managers will acquire smaller robos and this trend is certain to continue. Although, this category or sector of the fintech world is receiving maximum retail interest. Innovation in the investment technology space has created a fierce race among start-ups. The increased competition is causing several robo-advisors to go out of business.There are currently 15 robo-advisers in Canada and they manage a total of just $8-billion.

    3) Hybrid human-tech models
    Although consumers like the automated services, they also want to access human advisors for support, questions, and guidance. Therefore, hybrid investment advice and management platforms are expected to overtake the technology-only robo-advisors.  According to Business Insider, hybrid human-robo advisors will manage 10 percent of all AUM by 2025.

    4) Integrating Artificial Intelligence 
    To make robos more “human-like, and thus more appealing to customers, will involve the integration of artificial intelligence.  Wealthfront is an example of a robo-advisor company that has integrated AI capabilities into its service. This is allowing the company to track account activity on its own product, to analyse and understand how account holders are making their financial decisions, investing and spending, in an effort to offer more tailored advice to their customers.

    5) Mobile Capacity
    Mobile is exploding in terms of time spend in nearly all areas of technology. Investment advisory services through mobile platforms have recently increased. More consumers are and will continue to perform more and more financial management tasks on their phones and some companies are soley replying on the app version rather than a web based version.

    6) Increased government regulation 
    Although robo-advisor market is still in its infancy, regulators are already taking notice of it. Last year, regulators in the US issued guidance with respect to automated investment advice providers, including robo-advisers. In the UK, robo-advisors are required to meet the same standards as their face-to-face equivalents. In Canada, regulators are taking notice and talking about open banking to collaborate with fintech companies for better product offerings for their customers.
    
    7) The 50-and-over Market 
    Robo-advisors are tuned generally towards the millennials who are used to have grown up with the Internet and digital technology. They were early adopters of smartphones, tablets and streaming services as these technologies appeared around the turn of the millennium, but in the decade that followed the digital habits of older Canadians began to align with those of millennials, making generational distinctions around the use of this technology less clear cut. Also, the older generation of Baby Boomers face complex retirement decisions as they figure out when to retire, how much money to withdraw and whether they’ll have enough money to last their whole lives. There’s a tremendous cost to consumers for not planning for their end of life and robo-advisors ahave a huge opportunity filling this gap and expanding their customer and revenue bases.

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
    Below are other major Canadian fintech companies and banks in this domain: 
    * Nest Wealth
    * WealthBar
    * Justwealth
    * ModernAdvisor
    * Mylo
    * Voleo
    * Koho
    * Questrade's Portfolio IQ
    * Invisor
    * BMO SmartFolio
    * ShareOwner (Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wealthsimple Financial Corp. (Canada))

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    The Company has been growing its asset size exponentially from CAD $0.4 billion in April 2015 to CAD $6.0 billion as of Jan 2020 which is 1400% growth in less than 5 years. Today the Canadian robo-advisors assets are CAD $8 billions implying Wealthsimple's share is 75%. However, the firm’s average account size is about $30,000. Clients with less than $100,000 in assets pay a 0.5 per cent annual fee implying Wealthsimple's revenues are $30-million a year. 

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
   
    Defining, tracking and reporting on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a critical process to review the health of a business. One common method to do so is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) which organizes KPIs across 4 focus areas. Additionally, the exact metrics for each of these 4 focus areas will differ based on your organization’s strategy, stage and sector.
    1. Financial: Shareholders view which looks at organizational financial performance and the use of financial resources
    2. Customer: Customers view taking into account organizational performance from their point of view or other key stakeholders that the organization is designed to serve
    3. Internal Processes: Measure of organizational performance through the lenses of the quality and efficiency related to our product or services or other key business processes
    4. Learning & Growth: Measure of organizational performance through the lenses of human capital, infrastructure, technology, culture and other core competencies that are key to breakthrough performance

    Wealthsimple's and its top 10 competitors were rated on 4 metrics in 2019. These were Total Funding, Revenue, CEO Score, Employees
    The top 10 competitors in Wealthsimple's competitive set are Wealthfront, WealthBar, Nest Wealth, Mylo, Lakeside Wealth Management, Acorns, Personal Capital, WeInvest, Altruist and AdvisorEngine. Together they have raised over 881.0M between their estimated 1.3K employees. 
    Wealthsimple's 
    1. Total Funding is ranked at third with an average of $98 million 
    2. Revenue is the ranked fourth among it's top 10 competitors. The top 10 competitors average 9M
    3. CEO score is the lowest at 64. The average score is rest of the competitors is 80 out of 100
    4. Employees metrics is ranked third among it's top 10 competitors. The top 10 competitors average 137

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    Wealthsimple is a market leader in the robo-advisory space in Canada. They outperform competitors in various product/service which is detailed out in question above.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    Firstly, my advise to the company is to start diversifying it's customer base by focusing on the 50+ market segment as baby boomers are catching up fast on the technological side due to the attitude and time to spare on learning new skills.
    Secondly, they should be optimize their marketing cost which is eating into lion share of their revenue thereby depleting shareholder value.
    Thirdly, they can start reaching out to masses by educating them on the importance of investing to gain inflation adjusted returns.  

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    The benefits will be increased market share, increased revenue, popularity, customer stickiness, boost their image and brand. 

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    1. In the current fintech industry, algorithms discriminate 40% less than traditional lenders. However, Wealthsimple needs to reduce this ethical bias at industry levels or achieve excellence. They should integrate Artificial Intelligence and hybrid human-tech models which can benefit to acquire the 50+ market. 
    2. Banks are competing with Fintechs and the problem is that latter do not have multiple products to offer to customers. This reduces the opportunity to expand thir revenue by limiting the cross-selling options and hence their growth. Also, banks have a reputation built over years and fall into regulatory framwork thereby securing customer confidence which is missing for fintechs.
    3. Wealthsimple can leverage their existing technologies, domain knowledge, expertise of advisors and market status to venture into above areas. They can additionally venture into analyzing customer churn rates.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    These are required to sustain competition in the market, increase the customer base, increase the profit margins, brand reputation.
